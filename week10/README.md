## Question 3.1

### What do these values mean?

1. **Nascent RNA Signal**: This represents the transcriptional activity in each nucleus. A higher value indicates that the cell is actively producing RNA, which is essential for gene expression.

2. **PCNA Signal**: This measures DNA replication or repair activity in the cell. High values indicate that the cell is preparing to divide or repairing damaged DNA.

3. **Log2 Ratio (Nascent RNA / PCNA)**: This compares transcriptional activity to DNA replication. A higher ratio suggests cells are focusing more on transcription, while a lower ratio suggests more replication activity.



## Question 3.2

### Observations from the Violin Plots

1. **Nascent RNA Signal**:
   - The gene **PIM2** shows the highest transcription activity, as seen from the broad and high nascent RNA signal distribution.
   - **POLR2B** shows very low transcription activity, aligning with its role in transcription machinery.

2. **PCNA Signal**:
   - **PIM2** also has the highest DNA replication activity.
   - **POLR2B** has minimal PCNA signal, indicating reduced DNA replication when it is knocked down.

3. **Log2 Ratio (Nascent RNA / PCNA)**:
   - **APEX1** has the highest ratio, showing that RNA transcription outweighs DNA replication in these cells.
   - **POLR2B** has the lowest ratio, reflecting that its knockdown significantly reduces transcription while leaving replication relatively higher.


### Biological Relevance

1. **APEX1**:
   - Known for its role in DNA repair. When knocked down, cells might reduce replication and focus on transcription, possibly to adapt to stress or damage.

2. **POLR2B**:
   - Part of RNA polymerase II, which is critical for transcription. Knocking it down directly suppresses transcription, explaining the low nascent RNA signal and ratio.
