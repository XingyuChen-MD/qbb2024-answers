1. Which feature appears to be under the highest level of purifying (negative) selection? How can you tell?
Exons.The expression values for exons drop the most as Minor Allele Frequency increases, indicating that they are subject to stronger negative selection pressure.


2. Why do you think most features start out more enriched at lower MAFs and become more depleted as the MAF increases?
Lower MAFs may suggest that these mutations haven't been subjected to selection yet. As the MAF rises, those mutations not favorable to survival are likely to be removed from the population through selection, leading to reduced enrichment at higher MAFs.
Another reason could be that mutations with lower MAFs might have mild effects and are not eliminated as quickly by selection. In contrast, higher MAFs may carry more severe consequences for gene function, increasing the likelihood of being selected against.
Do the relative enrichment/depletion patterns of different features make sense? Explain.

3. Does the relative levels of enrichment/depletion of features with respect to each other make sense? Explain.
Yes. Exons are more sensitive to mutations because changes to protein sequences directly affect function, which places exons under the strongest purifying selection. Regulatory regions, which control gene expression, experience moderate impact from mutations since they donâ€™t usually result in the complete loss of protein function. Most mutations in introns are neutral as they are removed during splicing, though mutations in splicing sites can disrupt proper splicing and protein production. Non-coding regions experience the least selection pressure, as they have limited influence on protein function and overall survival. In general, features more directly linked to protein function and expression levels face stronger selective pressures.
